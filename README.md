This is the Alpha code of my ML bot, Not allowed to show anything beyond this stage.


Essentially, it takes unique visual patterns and runs it through the XML file that has been created through a cascade classifier.
Image shows what the bot was taught to look for when fighting a specific NPC.

WARNING, THE CODE IS NOT FUNCTIONAL AND ALOT OF WORK WOULD NEED TO BE DONE FOR IT TO BE FUNCTIONAL. Enjoy the code though.
